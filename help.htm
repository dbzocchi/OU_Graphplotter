		<h3><a name="KeyboardControl" id="KeyboardControl">2. Keyboard control</a></h3>
		<p>
        	All of the Graphplotter components can be controlled by using the keyboard as an alternative to the mouse. To begin, 
            you  have to select Graphplotter, which you can do by clicking inside it. An alternative, which works in some browsers, 
            is to repeatedly press the Tab key (this is called <em>tabbing</em>) until a component of Graphplotter is highlighted 
            by a  border around it.
      </p>
		<p>
        	A border  like this around a Graphplotter component indicates that the component has <em>keyboard focus 
            </em>(or <em>focus</em> for short). When a  component has focus, you can control it with the keyboard. You can give a 
            component focus in the  following ways (some methods work for only some components). 
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
            	Click on the component (e.g. an input box). 
          </li>
			<li>
				Use the shortcut keys given in the next section.
          </li>
			<li>
            	Tab through the components: each time you press the Tab key the focus is transferred to the next component in order. 
                You can tab backwards by pressing the Tab key while holding down the Shift key (Shift+Tab). 
          </li>
			<li>
            	For the graphing area, move the mouse pointer over this area.
          </li>
	  	</ul>
        <p>
      		When a component has focus, keyboard commands are available
   	  </p>
		<ul>
          <li>
                When one of the tabs (e.g. One graph, Two graphs) has focus, pressing the Enter key activates that tab. 
          </li>
            <li>
                When a button has focus, pressing the Space key presses the button. 
          </li>
            <li>
                When an input box has focus, you can type characters into it. You must press the Enter key (while the box has focus) 
                or change focus to another component for the change to take effect. 
          </li>
            <li>
                When a drop-down selector for choosing a function is in focus, pressing the Enter key or Space bar opens the 
                drop-down list. Use the Up and Down arrow keys to navigate the list and then press the Enter key or Space bar to 
                choose the highlighted option. The Home and End keys take you to the first and last functions in the list. 
          </li>
            <li>
                When a slider has focus, pressing the Left or Right arrow keys moves the slider left and right. If you hold down 
                the Ctrl key while pressing an arrow key, then the slider moves faster. To move directly to the lower or upper limit 
                of the slider, press the Home or End key, respectively. 
          </li>
      	</ul>      
        <p>
        	To reload Graphplotter, make sure that the focus is on the web page and press the F5 key.

		<h3><a name="PlottingFunction" id="PlottingFunction">4. Choosing a function</a></h3>
		<p>
        	Graphplotter can plot graphs of one or two functions. The functions are chosen by using the drop-down selectors 
            at the top of the left-hand panel. You can choose to show one or two graphs by clicking on the appropriate tab 
            at the top of the application (or using keyboard control as described in Section 2).  The left- and right-hand 
            selectors produce blue and green graphs, respectively.
      </p>
		<p>
        	To choose a predefined function, click on either of the drop-down selectors and then click on the desired 
            function. The graph is plotted in the right-hand panel with the equation of the function displayed above. You 
            can change the values of the constants &ndash; this is described in the next section.
      </p>
		<p>
        	To enter your own function, click on the Custom function option at the bottom of the drop-down list of functions. 
            A Custom function input box appears at the bottom of the panel. You can type your own function into this box, 
            using the syntax described in Section 11. (You can give the box focus by tabbing to it once you have selected 
            Custom function.) After typing in a custom function, press the Enter key to plot its graph and display its equation. 
      </p>
		<p>		  
        	When you enter a function in the custom function box, some information text appears in the text area at the bottom 
            of the left-hand panel.

            either of these to change the value of a constant.
   	  </p>

            to be the mathematical constant <em>e</em>.
        </p>
  		<p>
        	The sliders have lower and upper limits,  which you can change if you wish. To change the lower limit to a lower value, 
            type the new limit into the input box above the slider and press the Enter key.  (This also sets the constant to that 
            value.) If you want to make the lower  limit higher than it already is, then type &lsquo;min=&rsquo; followed by the 
            new limit (e.g. &lsquo;min=&minus;10&rsquo;) into the input box above the slider and press the Enter key.
      </p>
  		<p>
        	Similarly, to make the upper limit higher, type the new limit into the input box above the slider and press the Enter 
            key. If you want to make the upper limit lower than it already is, then type &lsquo;max=&rsquo; followed by the new 
            limit (e.g. &lsquo;max=10&rsquo;) into the input box above the slider  and press the Enter key.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        	If no line or curve is displayed in the  graphing area, then this may be because no part of the graph of the function is 
            in the viewable area.&nbsp; To reset the  viewable area to what it was when the function was selected, click on the

		<h3><a name="Reading" id="Reading">9. Finding the coordinates of a point on a graph</a></h3>
		<p>
        	Sometimes you may want to find the coordinates of a point on a line or curve, such as an <em>x</em>-intercept, the 
            vertex of a parabola or the intersection point of  two graphs. You can find the coordinates of a point on a graph by 
            using the Trace option and zooming in on the point.

        	In general, the syntax is as follows. 
        </p>
		<ul>
   			<li>* for multiplication</li>
	  	</ul>
	  <ul>
   			<li>/ for division</li>
  	  </ul>
	  	<ul>
		  <li>^ for exponentiation </li>
  	  	</ul>
		<ul>
   			<li>sqrt( ) for square root</li>
	  	</ul>
		<ul>
       	  	<li>sin( ), cos( ), tan( ) for sine, cosine and tangent </li>
  		</ul>
  		<ul>
          <li>asin( ), acos( ), atan( ) for sin<sup>-1</sup>, cos<sup>-1</sup> and tan<sup>-1</sup>(typing in 
	           sin^(-1), for example, gives a syntax error)</li>
        </ul>
		<ul>
          	<li>ln( ) for natural logarithm</li>
  	  </ul>
		<ul>
          	<li>e for the mathematical constant e = 2.718282</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>    
		    <li>abs( ) for absolute value </li>

        <ul>                
          	<li>floor( ), ceil( ), round( ) for the previous, next, and nearest integer, respectively</li>        
   	    </ul>
        <p>
        	Here are  some more examples of expressions that can be typed in the box: 
        </p>
	  	<blockquote>
	    	<p>e^(2-x)*ln(x^2+1)</p>
		  	<p>tan(pi*x/3)+acos(x)</p>
		  	<p>max(sin(2*x),0)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
        	Note that the unit of measurement for custom trigonometric  functions is the radian. If <em>x</em> is  measured in 
            degrees, then you will need to multiply it by pi/180 to change it  into radians. For example, to plot 
            <em>y</em> = sin <em>x</em> with <em>x</em> in degrees using the custom function option, enter sin  (x*pi/180). 
            Then alter the x min, x max, y min, y max values as appropriate. 
        </p>
		<p>
        	If &lsquo;Two graphs&rsquo; is selected, and one of  your functions is a custom trigonometric function while the other 
            is a predefined  function, then you should make sure that the Radians option is ticked and that  the predefined 
            function also uses radians. If you do not do this, then the two graphs will be drawn with different units for 
            <em>x</em>. 
        </p>
		<p>
        	Take care with powers. For example, 2^3^4 means 2^(3^4) and sin(x+1)^2 means (sin(x+1))^2. When in doubt, use brackets!
        </p>
		<p>
        	You can omit a * between a number and a letter. For example, you can type 5x + 5sin(x) as an alternative to 5 * x + 5 * sin(x). 
        </p>
	  	<p>
        	<strong>Custom functions with </strong><strong>constants</strong> 
        </p>
  		<p>
        	A custom function can contain up to four constants,  but these must be named A, B, C or D. For example, you could type any of the 
            following expressions into the custom function input box:
        </p>
	  	<blockquote>
            <p>A*x^2+B*x+C </p>
            <p>A*x^3+B*x^2+3*x-2</p>
            <p>A*(sin(B*x))^2+C*(cos(D*x))^2</p>
	  	</blockquote>
		<p>
        	An input box and a slider are provided for each constant.
